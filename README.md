Welcome to Hobble Version -0.1
A Simple OS SIM By John Bingley.

Hobble : to walk with difficulty because of injury or weakness.

	I decided to try to use Lanterna, a ncurses type library for Java. For the challange of using something new, with good documentation, but virtually no online samples. There is virtually NOTHING in eamples or tutorials online. 
	The JavaDoc is complete, and I'm finding it very challanging using solely Documentation to implement a TXT GUI with Lantern.
